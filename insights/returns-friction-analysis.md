## Executive Summary

Our returns experience generates significant negative sentiment despite a technically generous policy. Key friction points around label generation, refund timing, and exchange complexity drive 34% of our negative CSAT scores. This analysis benchmarks against competitors (notably Summit Co-op's legendary policy) and quantifies the CLV impact of returns handling.

## Returns Volume Overview

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Q3 2025 | YoY Change |
|--------|---------|---------|------------|
| Total returns | 18,234 | 14,891 | +22% |
| Return rate | 12.4% | 11.8% | +5% |
| Return reason: "Didn't fit" | 47% | 45% | +4% |
| Return reason: "Not as expected" | 28% | 29% | -3% |
| Return reason: "Changed mind" | 18% | 19% | -5% |
| Return reason: "Defective" | 7% | 7% | — |

**Industry benchmark:** Outdoor gear return rates average 15-20%. Our 12.4% is actually strong, but the experience score is poor.

## Support Ticket Analysis

### Returns-Related Ticket Categories

| Category | Volume | % of Total | Avg Resolution Time |
|----------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| "Where's my refund?" | 1,847 | 38% | 4.2 hours |
| Return label issues | 1,223 | 25% | 2.8 hours |
| Exchange process confusion | 892 | 18% | 6.1 hours |
| Policy questions | 634 | 13% | 1.4 hours |
| Defective item disputes | 296 | 6% | 8.7 hours |

**Insight:** 63% of returns tickets are about process friction, not policy dissatisfaction.

## Key Pain Points

### 1. Return Label Generation (25% of tickets)

Current process requires customers to:
1. Log into account
2. Find order in history
3. Select items to return
4. Choose reason
5. Print label (no email option)
6. Package item themselves

> "I don't have a printer. Why is this so complicated? PrimeGear sends me a QR code I can show at Whole Foods." — Support ticket #41023

> "I started the return on my phone but it says I need to print something. I gave up and just kept the jacket I don't want." — Support ticket #41892

**Data point:** 23% of return initiations are abandoned at the "print label" step.

### 2. Refund Timing Transparency (38% of tickets)

| Refund Stage | Actual Time | Customer Expectation | Gap |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|-----|
| Receive package | 3-5 days | 2-3 days | -2 days |
| Process return | 2-3 days | Same day | -2 days |
| Issue refund | 3-5 business days | 1-2 days | -3 days |
| **Total** | **8-13 days** | **3-5 days** | **-8 days** |

> "It's been two weeks since I shipped it back. Tracking shows delivered. Where is my money?" — Support ticket #42156

> "You have my item AND my money. That doesn't feel fair." — Customer interview

### 3. Exchange Complexity (18% of tickets)

Current exchange process:
1. Return original item (full process above)
2. Wait for refund
3. Place new order
4. Pay again (until refund processes)

> "I just wanted a medium instead of a large. Why do I have to buy the same jacket twice and wait for you to refund me?" — Support ticket #41567

> "Summit Co-op let me walk in, hand them the wrong size, and walk out with the right one. Why can't you do that online?" — Customer interview

## Competitor Benchmarking

### Summit Co-op Return Policy

| Aspect | Summit Co-op | Contoso |
|--------|-----|---------|
| Return window | 1 year (members) | 60 days |
| Label generation | Email QR code | Print only |
| Drop-off options | 180+ stores, UPS, USPS | UPS only |
| Exchange process | Direct swap | Return + repurchase |
| Defective items | Lifetime guarantee | 60 days |
| Refund speed | 3-5 days | 8-13 days |

> "Summit Co-op's return policy is why I shop there even when you're cheaper. I know I can bring anything back if it doesn't work on the trail." — Customer interview

### Alpine Trailwear "Ironclad Guarantee"

- Lifetime repair or replacement for defects
- Worn Wear accepts returns of any condition
- Store credit vs. refund option (higher adoption, faster)

### PrimeGear Returns

- QR code to phone (no printing)
- Whole Foods, Kohl's, PrimeGear locker drop-off
- Instant refund option (for Prime members on select items)
- "Try before you buy" on eligible items

## Financial Analysis

### Cost of Returns

| Cost Category | Per Return | Annual (est.) |
|---------------|------------|---------------|
| Shipping (prepaid label) | $8.40 | $734K |
| Processing & inspection | $4.20 | $367K |
| Restocking/liquidation loss | $12.80 | $1.12M |
| Customer support (tickets) | $3.60 | $315K |
| **Total cost per return** | **$29.00** | **$2.54M** |

### CLV Impact of Returns Experience

| Returns Experience | 12-Month Repurchase Rate | Avg CLV |
|--------------------|------------------------|---------|
| Smooth return | 78% | $342 |
| Friction return | 41% | $187 |
| No return (baseline) | 62% | $289 |

**Insight:** Customers with smooth returns are MORE likely to repurchase than those who never returned. Friction returns cut CLV nearly in half.

## Key Quotes by Theme

### Frustration
> "I feel like you're making it hard on purpose so I won't return things. That makes me not want to buy things." — Customer interview

> "The experience was so bad I disputed the charge with my credit card instead of dealing with your return process." — Support ticket #40234

### Comparison to Competitors
> "I just returned $300 of stuff to PrimeGear in 45 seconds at the Whole Foods down the street. This took me an hour." — Customer interview

> "Summit Co-op treats returns like a chance to help me. You treat it like I'm stealing from you." — NPS verbatim

### Positive Experiences (rare)
> "When I called about the defective zipper, the agent was amazing and shipped a replacement before I even sent back the broken one. Why isn't it always like this?" — Support ticket #42891

## Recommendations

| Initiative | Impact | Effort | Cost | Priority |
|------------|--------|--------|------|----------|
| QR code returns (no printing) | -23% abandonment | Medium | $45K | P0 |
| Real-time refund tracking | -38% "where's my refund" tickets | Low | $15K | P0 |
| Instant refund (account credit) | +28% satisfaction, faster resolution | Medium | $80K | P1 |
| Direct exchange flow | -18% exchange tickets | High | $120K | P1 |
| Expanded drop-off partners | +convenience, -shipping cost | High | Varies | P2 |
| Extended return window (loyalty tiers) | +retention, +premium perception | Low | Revenue impact TBD | P2 |

## Implications

Returns are a moment of truth that we're currently failing. The data shows:

1. **Smooth returns drive loyalty** — 78% repurchase rate vs. 41% for friction returns
2. **Process, not policy** — Our 60-day window is fine; the execution is the problem
3. **Quick wins exist** — QR codes and tracking transparency are low-effort, high-impact

Consider tying improved returns experience to [Loyalty Program v2](/specs/loyalty-program-v2.md) — extended return windows for tier members, instant credits for exchanges.
