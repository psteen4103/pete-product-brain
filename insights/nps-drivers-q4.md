## Promoter Verbatims by Theme

### Product Quality

> "The tent I bought has survived three camping trips in brutal weather. Worth every penny. I recommend Contoso to everyone in my hiking group." — NPS 10, verified purchase

> "Finally found hiking boots that don't destroy my feet. You've earned a customer for life." — NPS 9, repeat customer

> "The sleeping bag is exactly as described — warm, lightweight, packs small. Exactly what I needed for the PCT section hike." — NPS 10, first-time buyer

### Selection & Discovery

> "You've got brands I can't find at Summit Co-op. That's why I come here first now." — NPS 9, 3-year customer

> "The filter options helped me find exactly the right size pack for my torso length. No other site makes it that easy." — NPS 10, verified purchase

### Value

> "Got the same jacket $40 cheaper than Ridgeline Outfitters. Free shipping sealed the deal." — NPS 9, price-compared

## Detractor Verbatims by Theme

### Shipping (58% mention rate)

> "Paid for 2-day shipping, took 9 days. Support offered a $10 credit like that makes it okay. I missed my camping trip." — NPS 2

> "Tracking said delivered but nothing at my door. Took two weeks and four emails to get a replacement. Never again." — NPS 1

> "'Ships in 1-2 days' is apparently a suggestion, not a promise. Three separate orders, all late." — NPS 4

### Checkout (47% mention rate)

> "Tried to buy one thing. Forced to create an account. Password requirements were insane. Gave up and bought from PrimeGear." — NPS 3

> "Your checkout is stuck in 2015. No Apple Pay, no saved addresses, forms that don't work on mobile. Come on." — NPS 4, returned customer

> "I had a promo code but couldn't find where to enter it. Abandoned cart." — NPS 5

### Website/Mobile (39% mention rate)

> "Site is so slow on my phone I assumed it was broken. Switched to laptop just to complete the order." — NPS 3

> "Filtering doesn't work. I selected 'size 10' and saw size 8 boots on the first page. Basics aren't working." — NPS 4

> "The mobile site made me want to throw my phone. Buttons too small, kept accidentally removing items from cart." — NPS 2

### Returns (31% mention rate)

> "Return policy is fine. Return PROCESS is a nightmare. No printer, no return. What year is this?" — NPS 3

> "Three weeks to process my return. I'd have paid a fee for faster refund." — NPS 4

### Support (18% mention rate)

> "Tried calling, 45-minute hold. Tried chat, 'offline.' Tried email, response in 5 days. How do I actually reach you?" — NPS 2

## Segment Analysis

### New Customers vs. Returning

| Metric | New Customers | Returning (2+) | Returning (5+) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| NPS | 24 | 38 | 51 |
| Promoter % | 39% | 54% | 68% |
| Detractor % | 21% | 12% | 8% |
| Primary detractor driver | Checkout (62%) | Shipping (54%) | Support (41%) |

**Insight:** New customer NPS is significantly lower, primarily driven by checkout friction. The checkout experience is filtering out potential loyal customers.

### By Order Value

| Order Value Tier | NPS | Sample Size |

| Under $50 | 28 | n=812 |
| $50-$150 | 34 | n=1,247 |
| $150-$300 | 38 | n=534 |
| $300+ | 41 | n=254 |

**Insight:** Higher-value customers are more satisfied. Lower-value customers may be more price-sensitive and less forgiving of friction.

### By Channel

| Purchase Channel | NPS | Primary Detractor |
|-----------------|-----|-------------------|
| Desktop web | 36 | Shipping delays |
| Mobile web | 22 | Checkout experience |
| Email link | 34 | Return process |

**Insight:** Mobile NPS of 22 is critical. Validates [Mobile Usability Study](/insights/mobile-usability-study.md) findings.

## Implications

The path to NPS 45+ requires fixing fundamentals first:

1. **Shipping** and **checkout** are responsible for 55% of detractor sentiment
2. **Mobile experience** is a multiplier — fixes here impact both drivers
3. **New customers** are most at risk — first impression is failing

The current [Checkout Redesign](/specs/checkout-redesign.md) addresses many checkout-related detractors. Recommend adding shipping transparency features to the spec scope.

**Target:** Achieve NPS 40 by Q2 2026 through checkout improvements alone. Full mobile app launch required for NPS 45+ goal.
