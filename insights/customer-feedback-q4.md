## Executive Summary

Q4 feedback reveals three dominant themes impacting customer satisfaction and conversion. These insights directly inform our [Checkout Redesign](/specs/checkout-redesign.md) and [Loyalty v2](/specs/loyalty-program-v2.md) initiatives.

## Theme 1: Checkout Friction (42% of feedback)

Customers consistently cite the checkout process as a barrier to purchase.

### Key Quotes

> "I had items in my cart and just gave up. Too many steps, and I didn't want to create yet another account." — NPS respondent, score 4

> "Why can't I just use Apple Pay like everywhere else? It's 2025." — Support ticket #34892

### Data Points
- 67% of cart abandoners cite "process too long" in exit surveys
- Account creation step has 34% drop-off rate
- Mobile users 2.3x more likely to abandon than desktop

## Theme 2: Loyalty Program Confusion (28% of feedback)

Current rewards program fails to create perceived value.

### Key Quotes

> "I've been shopping here for two years and have no idea what my points are worth or how to use them." — Interview participant

> "The rewards feel pointless. I'd rather get actual discounts than accumulate points I'll never use." — NPS respondent, score 5

### Data Points
- 45% of surveyed members don't know their point balance
- "How do I redeem points?" is #3 support inquiry
- Competitors with tiered programs have 2x higher retention

## Theme 3: Shipping Concerns (18% of feedback)

Transparency and options around shipping drive frustration.

### Key Quotes

> "Free shipping at $75 seems reasonable until you realize the thing you want is $68. Just make it $50 like everyone else." — NPS respondent, score 6

> "I needed the tent for my trip but there was no express option for my area." — Support ticket #35201

### Data Points
- Free shipping threshold frequently cited in 1-2 star reviews
- Rural customers report limited shipping speed options
