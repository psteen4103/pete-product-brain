# Meeting Prep Brief

Generate a context document to walk into any meeting fully prepared.

## Input

Provide:
- **Meeting topic** or agenda items
- **Attendees** (optional, helps tailor depth)
- **Your role** in the meeting (presenting, listening, deciding)

## Process

1. **Search** the knowledge repo for relevant context:
   - Specs related to the topic
   - Recent insights or feedback
   - Past decisions or meeting notes
   - Open issues or blockers
2. **Summarize** key points from each source (2-3 bullets max)
3. **Identify** what attendees likely care about
4. **List** open questions that may arise
5. **Prepare** your talking points or asks

## Output

A briefing document with:

- **Context**: What's this about, why now
- **Key Facts**: Numbered list of must-know points
- **Stakeholder Lens**: What each attendee cares about
- **Open Questions**: Unresolved items likely to surface
- **Your Prep**: Talking points, asks, or decision criteria
- **References**: Links to source docs for deeper dive
