## Positioning Statement

**For outdoor enthusiasts who want quality gear without the premium price or pretense**, Contoso is the **sustainable outdoor retailer** that makes expert guidance and eco-conscious choices accessible to everyone—unlike Summit Co-op (membership-gated experiences) or Alpine Trailwear (premium pricing), we believe **adventure shouldn't require a trust fund or a club card**.

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Positioning | Our Counterposition |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Summit Co-op** | Co-op community, in-store experiences | Digital-first accessibility; no membership required for value |
| **Alpine Trailwear** | Premium sustainability, brand activism | Sustainable without the premium tax; action over activism |
| **Ridgeline Outfitters** | Enthusiast expertise, curated selection | Broader catalog with same expert guidance; beginners welcome |
| **PrimeGear** | Endless selection, pure convenience | Curated expertise; we know gear, not just inventory |

### Where We Win

**Our quadrant:** Relationship-driven + accessible pricing. We're building Summit Co-op's community feel and Alpine Trailwear's sustainability cred at a price point that doesn't exclude.
