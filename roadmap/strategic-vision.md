## Vision

**By 2030, Contoso will be the most trusted name in sustainable outdoor gear—where every purchase powers regeneration, not just recreation.**

We see a future where:
- **60% of our catalog** is eco-certified or circular (up from 40% today)
- **Every customer** can track their environmental impact in real-time
- **Adventure is inclusive**—gear and guidance for every body, budget, and background
- **Community drives discovery**—our members teach and inspire each other

## Core Values

| Value | What It Means | How We Live It |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| 🌲 **Trail First** | The outdoors shapes every decision | Product teams hike together; we test what we sell |
| ♻️ **Lighter Footprint** | Sustainability isn't a feature, it's the foundation | Carbon-offset shipping, trade-in program, eco-scoring on every product |
| 🔦 **Guiding Light** | Expertise shared freely creates better adventurers | Gearhead advisors, sizing guarantees, educational content |
| 🤝 **Summit Together** | Community over competition | Social features, loyalty program, local event partnerships |
| ⚡ **Move Fast, Pack Light** | Agility wins; complexity kills | Ship weekly, measure ruthlessly, deprecate what doesn't work |

## Strategic Pillars

These three pillars guide prioritization decisions and resource allocation. Every major initiative should map to at least one pillar.

### 1. Frictionless Experience
*Remove every obstacle between intent and adventure.*

- **Why it matters:** 68% cart abandonment means customers want our gear but can't get through checkout. Mobile conversion lags desktop by 14 points. Friction costs us $20M+ annually.
- **2026 Focus:** [Checkout Redesign](/specs/checkout-redesign.md), [Mobile App v3](/specs/mobile-app-v3.md)
- **Success Metric:** Checkout conversion from 32% → 45%

### 2. Earned Loyalty
*Turn transactions into relationships through genuine value exchange.*

- **Why it matters:** Members spend 2.3x more than guests, but our loyalty NPS (+12) trails our brand NPS (+45) by 33 points. The program isn't earning its keep.
- **2026 Focus:** [Trail Rewards v2](/specs/loyalty-program-v2.md), [Returns Experience](/specs/returns-experience.md)
- **Success Metric:** Loyalty program NPS from +12 → +35

### 3. Sustainability Leadership
*Make Contoso the default choice for eco-conscious adventurers.*

- **Why it matters:** 67% of customers say sustainability influences their purchase decisions, but only 23% know about our eco initiatives. We're leading without getting credit.
- **2026 Focus:** [Sustainability Dashboard](/specs/sustainability-dashboard.md), eco-product discovery
- **Success Metric:** Sustainability awareness from 23% → 60%

## Strategic Bets for 2026-2028

| Bet | Thesis | Risk | Payoff Window |
|-----|--------|------|---------------|
| **Sustainability as brand moat** | Eco-leadership compounds; competitors can't easily replicate supply chain work | Consumer priorities shift away from sustainability | 18-24 months |
| **Mobile-native Gen Z capture** | Gen Z discovers gear through content, buys through apps; we need native presence | React Native may not match platform expectations | 12-18 months |
| **International expansion (CA/UK)** | North American market maturing; Canada/UK share outdoor culture and shipping corridors | Currency risk, logistics complexity | 24-36 months |

---

## Decision-Making Principles

When facing trade-offs, apply these principles in order:

1. **Customer over company** — If it's good for adventurers, it's good for Contoso
2. **Long-term over short-term** — Quarterly metrics don't override strategic positioning
3. **Data over opinion** — Strong opinions, loosely held; evidence changes minds
4. **Speed over perfection** — Shipping teaches faster than planning
5. **Sustainability over convenience** — Easy isn't always right
