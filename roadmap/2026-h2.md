## Resource Planning

**Hiring needs:**

- ML Engineer x2 (Q2 2026)
- International Operations Manager (Q3 2026)

**Capacity assumptions:**
- H1 teams roll onto H2 initiatives by Q3
- Tech debt continues at 20% allocation
- Platform team shifts to international infra Q4

## Risks & Open Questions

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Mobile PM hiring delays | Interim lead from checkout team |
| ML model performance | Start with rule-based personalization as fallback |
| International regulatory complexity | Legal review in Q2, scope reduction if needed |
| H1 delays cascade to H2 | Built-in 4-week buffer for Mobile App v3 |

**Open Questions:**
1. Should international launch include loyalty program? (Likely Phase 2)
2. Mobile app: native vs. React Native? (Architecture decision Q2)
3. Search personalization: buy vs. build ML infrastructure?
