**Source:** Summit Co-op Annual Stewardship Report 2025, Morgan Stanley Retail Research, internal analysis  
**Date:** January 2026

---

## Company Overview

- **Founded:** 1938 (co-op model since inception)
- **Revenue:** $4.1B (2025), up 6% YoY
- **Stores:** 182 retail locations across 42 states
- **E-commerce share:** 38% of total revenue (~$1.56B)
- **Employees:** 16,000+ (70% part-time "green vests")

## Membership Program Analysis

### Scale & Economics
- **Total members:** 23.1M active co-op members (as of Q4 2025)
- **Lifetime membership fee:** $30 (one-time, lifetime)
- **Annual dividend:** 10% back on eligible purchases
- **Member revenue concentration:** Members drive 85% of total sales

### Program Strengths
- Emotional connection to co-op mission drives loyalty
- Dividend creates "free money" psychology, encourages annual shopping
- Used gear program (Re/Supply) integrated into membership experience
- Member-exclusive events and classes build community

### Program Weaknesses
- One-time fee means no recurring revenue from membership itself
- 10% dividend is expensive—erodes margin on every transaction
- Limited personalization despite massive member base
- Dividend timing (March annually) creates uneven purchase patterns

## Digital Experience Assessment

### Strengths
- Best-in-class product information (detailed specs, comparison tools)
- Expert advice integration (chat with specialists)
- Robust store inventory visibility
- Used gear marketplace well-executed

### Weaknesses
- Mobile app dated (3.2★ App Store rating)
- Checkout flow requires 6+ steps
- Recommendation engine feels basic—mostly collaborative filtering
- Search results lack personalization
- Limited visual search capabilities

## Strategic Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Evidence | Contoso Opportunity |
|---------------|----------|---------------------|
| Co-op governance limits agility | 3-year lag on loyalty program updates | Move faster on loyalty innovation |
| Margin pressure from dividend | Thin margins restrict tech investment | Invest in AI/ML personalization |
| In-store bias | Digital seen as support to stores | Pure-play digital excellence |
| Sustainability "table stakes" | No longer differentiated on mission | Out-innovate on eco initiatives |

## What Contoso Can Learn

### Adopt
- **Expert credibility:** Summit Co-op's specialist knowledge builds trust. Consider "Contoso Guides" program
- **Used gear integration:** Re/Supply shows appetite for recommerce at scale
- **Event-driven engagement:** Classes and trips create emotional connection

### Avoid
- **Expensive universal dividend:** Tier benefits by engagement level instead
- **Governance complexity:** Stay nimble on program changes
- **One-time fee trap:** Recurring engagement model preferred

## Strategic Implications

1. **Loyalty program design:** Contoso's tiered approach ([Loyalty v2](/specs/loyalty-program-v2.md)) can be more margin-efficient than Summit Co-op's flat dividend
2. **Digital-first advantage:** With no stores to protect, Contoso can optimize purely for e-commerce conversion
3. **Personalization gap:** Summit Co-op's 23M members with limited personalization = opportunity to differentiate on relevance
4. **Speed as weapon:** Co-op structure slows Summit Co-op; Contoso can ship features faster
