## DTC Strategic Playbook

|-------|-------------------|-------|
| Cotopaxi | Questival events, ambassador program | 50+ events/year, 500 ambassadors |
| Rumpl | Artist collabs, limited drops | 12 drops/year, 100K waitlist |

| Black Crows | Athlete sponsorship, backcountry film | 2M social following |

- **Transparent pricing:** Everlane-style cost breakdowns gaining traction

## Implications for Marketplace vs. Owned Brands

### The Contoso Question
With 50K+ products from established brands, should Contoso:
1. Stay pure marketplace (curate third-party brands)
2. Launch private label (compete with suppliers)
3. Acquire/partner with emerging DTC brands

### Analysis

| Strategy | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Pure marketplace | Supplier relationships, breadth | Lower margins, commoditized |
| Private label | Higher margin, differentiation | Supplier conflict, quality risk |
| DTC partnerships | Best of both, brand heat | Complex deals, limited control |

### Recommendation
**Hybrid approach:** Partner with 2-3 emerging DTC brands for exclusive colorways/products (not acquisitions). Maintains supplier relationships while accessing DTC energy.

## Strategic Implications

1. **Community is the moat:** DTC brands win on community, not product alone. Contoso needs community strategy beyond transactions
2. **Impact matters:** Every successful DTC brand has clear impact story. [Loyalty v2](/specs/loyalty-program-v2.md) sustainability tier addresses this
3. **Content investment:** DTC brands outspend on content. Contoso content budget should increase 40%+ for 2026
4. **Exclusivity opportunities:** Partner with hot DTC brands for Contoso-exclusive products (differentiation without private label risk)
5. **Drop culture:** Limited releases drive urgency. Consider "Contoso Selects" curated drops
